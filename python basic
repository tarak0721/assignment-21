1. Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.
from datetime import date
now = date.today()
now_str = now.isoformat()
with open('today.txt', 'wt') as output:
    print(now_str, file=output)
2. Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string
with open('today.txt', 'rt') as input:
    today_string = input.read()
    today_string

3. Parse the date from today_string.
from datetime import datetime
fmt = '%Y-%m-%d\n'
datetime.strptime(today_string, fmt)

4. List the files in your current directory
 import os
os.listdir('.')
5. Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).
 os.listdir('..')

6. Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.
 !python multi_process.py

7. Create a date object of your day of birth.
 my_day = date(1996, 8, 10)
my_day
8. What day of the week was your day of birth?
 With weekday(), Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. With isoweekday(), Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7. Therefore, this date is a Saturday.

my_day.weekday()

my_day.isoweekday()

9. When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?
 from datetime import timedelta
ten_thousand = my_day + timedelta(days=10000)
ten_thousand
